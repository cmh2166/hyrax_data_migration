# Renegade Hyrax Data Migration Docs

Goals:
- gather use cases and examples around migrating to or setting up Hyrax Data Models & Application Profiles
- Make explicit the Hyrax codebase presumptions or current core data modeling & application profile decisions
- Align the Hyrax core data model + MAPs with practices that emerge from collected feedback, use cases, or examples (i.e. converge around common practices in our communities)
- Look for areas of data modeling & Hyrax MAPs convergence in order to begin a process of creating best practices for Hyrax & adjacent applications, including links to existing resources on this work
- Give some examples and normalized but not prescriptive proposals for how to override, extend, or enhance the Hyrax data models or MAP such that it diverges as little as possible from a shared community understanding
- Identify code behaviors, especially those that effect end users, that are driven primarily by data models and how to improve this behaviors + interactions

We hope this work, which is scoped for collection and discussion over the next month, will help established Samvera community groups in moving hyrax data model and MAP decisions forward. These are not meant to be prescriptive or final in any way.
