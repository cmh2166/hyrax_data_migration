# Renegade Hyrax Data Migration Docs

## Goals:
- [Gather use cases and examples around migrating to or setting up Hyrax Data Models & Application Profiles.](https://github.com/cmh2166/hyrax_data_migration/issues/3)
- [Make explicit the Hyrax codebase presumptions or current core data modeling & application profile decisions.](https://github.com/cmh2166/hyrax_data_migration/issues/2)
- Align the Hyrax core data model + MAPs with practices that emerge from collected feedback, use cases, or examples (i.e. converge around common practices in our communities)
- [Look for areas of Hyrax metadata/data work convergence in order to begin a process of creating best practices for Hyrax & adjacent applications, including links to existing resources.](https://github.com/cmh2166/hyrax_data_migration/issues/4)
- Give some examples and normalized but not prescriptive proposals for how to override, extend, or enhance the Hyrax data models or MAP such that it diverges as little as possible from a shared community understanding.
- Identify code behaviors, especially those that effect end users, that are driven primarily by data models and how to improve this behaviors + interactions.

We hope this work, which is scoped for collection and discussion over the next month, will help established Samvera community groups in moving hyrax data model and MAP decisions forward. These are not meant to be prescriptive or final in any way.

## Get Involved / Questions:

Please open an issue on the repository. We're managing our work there as well.

## Artifacts Generated So Far:
